We relied on current technology and designed a sterling page. Beautiful webfonts are deployed and the site is responsive. It fits itself into the size of the browser window, so that it stays optimally readable on the smartphone as well as on the desktop.\n<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"gridWidth4 gridPos3\">\n<h2>Statically generated with Hyde\/Python<\/h2>\n<p>\nThere are completely static pages on the server, just plain HTML-files. The trick: the site is generated with the static website generator <a href=\"http:\/\/hyde.github.io\/\">Hyde<\/a> and then uploaded. That has enormous advantages: the site is fast, secure, low-maintenance and still comfortably usable.\nWe didn't want to waive a newsfeed, so this is generated by Hyde in the ATOM-format. For our image gallery we extended Hyde with a plugin, of which more later.\n<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"gridWidth3 gridPos7\">\n\n<h2>The Image Gallery<\/h2>\n\n<p>We want to present our images particularly nice, \nthat\u2019s why we went to great effort with the image gallery. The centerpiece of the gallery is the photo album viewer. I  summarized here some noticeable properties of the slider.<\/p>\n<p>\nHere embedded the album \u00bb<a title=\"Latest Images\" href=\"https:\/\/silber-und-blei.com\/galerie\/Neueste_Bilder.html\">Neuste Bilder<\/a>\u00ab of Silber &amp; Blei:\n<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n<iframe\n  width=\"100%\"\n  height=\"736px\"\n  src=\"https:\/\/silber-und-blei.com\/galerie\/embed\/Neueste_Bilder.html\"\n  allowfullscreen\n  frameBorder=\"0\"><\/iframe>\n\n\n<div class=\"gridRow\">\n<div class=\"gridWidth2 gridPos0\">\n<h3>responsive<\/h3>\n<p>\nThe album viewer is completely responsive and adapts fully to the available space. You can try this yourself on an <a href=\"http:\/\/silber-und-blei.com\/galerie\/Friedhofsengel.html\">album page<\/a>. Just change the size of the browser window and observe what happens.\n<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"gridWidth2 gridPos2\">\n<h3>versatile<\/h3>\n<p>There are different cases in which an album is integrated. On the one hand the page of the album itself, on the other hand an album can be included on every other page. Furthermore all albums have their own address to embed them as Iframe on other webpages. Provided that the browser supports it, an album can even activate <strong>full screen mode<\/strong>.\n<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"gridWidth2 gridPos4\">\n<h3>embeddable<\/h3>\n<p>As you see on this page, an album can be embedded on another webpage. Special web pages are genearted for this. An album knows the address of its embed-version and offers a small code-generator. Thanks to the great adaptability of the slider, concerning the format, we took a pass on requiring static sizes. The author of the foreign page can fit in the album just right. Of course we hope to gain bigger reach with this feature and we\u2019d be happy about spottings of our albums in the wilderness.\n<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"gridWidth2 gridPos6\">\n<h3>universal<\/h3>\n<p>Each instance of the album uses the same code, may it be as Iframe or on the album page. Its the  progression of code of <a href=\"\/en\/archive\/2013-01-31_big-business\">das Auto. Magazine<\/a>. The thumbnails and the big display of the images are using the same base. By extending the objects and by different configuration the two forms come into being. To change into full screen mode an album doesn\u2019t even need new initialization.\n<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"gridWidth2 gridPos8\">\n<h3>simple<\/h3>\n<p>For image management we wrote a plugin for Hyde in Python. The plugin generates thumbnails and the big images when the site is processed. An album is a configuration file mainly consisting of a list of images. To include an album its enough to know its internal name: <code title=\"jinja2 the template language is jinja2\">{{make_album( 'Neueste_Bilder', ['autoplay', 'no-thumbs']) }}<\/code>. The example is taken straight from our homepage.\n<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div><div class=\"diaryEntryFooter\"><a class=\"permalink\" href=\"\/en\/archive\/2013-11-12_silber-und-blei\">Permalink<\/a> Tuesday, November 12, 2013 6:50:43 PM Europe\/Berlin<div class=\"filters\">Filters: <ul><li><a rel=\"tag\" href=\"\/en\/diary\/news\">News<\/a><\/li><li><a rel=\"tag\" href=\"\/en\/diary\/graphicdesign\">Graphic Design<\/a><\/li><li><a rel=\"tag\" href=\"\/en\/diary\/conception\">Conception<\/a><\/li><li><a rel=\"tag\" href=\"\/en\/diary\/code\">Web and Code<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/div><\/div><\/div>"}
