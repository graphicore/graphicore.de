CineCita aims to improve general access to audiovisual media and to increase media literacy with rural populations in the region. During the tour, a smart travelling \u201ccine-bus\u201d visits villages in Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia, screening a selected programme of international short films and organizing participative video workshops for local communities.  Screenings are free of charge and held at public places. The selected programme focuses on female perspectives, giving a voice to women\u2019s narratives, from both Europe and Latin America. In the video workshops, young women learn to shoot their own short documentary video, empowering them with audiovisual skills and inspiring them to tell their own stories. An international team of organizers accompanies the workshop participants, while documenting an excerpt of their everyday lives on video themselves. Together, screenings and workshops provide a means of an exchange and networking between the Central Andean Region and Europe.  At the conclusion of each tour stop, the young directors may present their work in form of a public screening. Their films are then sent on the road with CineCita and shown to further audiences in the region.\" \/><\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n<\/div><div class=\"gridRow\">\n<h2>Realisation<\/h2>\n<div class=\"gridWidth5 gridPos0\">\n<h3>Content Management<\/h3>\n<p>The site is running a custom made content management system. I made it with <a href=\"http:\/\/php.net\/\">PHP5<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/zendframework.com\/\">Zend Framework<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.doctrine-project.org\/\">Doctrine ORM<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/htmlpurifier.org\/\">HTMLPurifier<\/a>. Cinecita.org is the technical predecessor of graphicore.de.<\/p>\n<h3>Internationalisation<\/h3>\n<p>English and Spanish where necessary. The most ready-to-use CMSs have mean support for Internationalisation. This CMS was planned from the beginneng with multiple languages in mind. Translation is the only thing to do, but if one translation is missing an available one is taken as fallback. Technically the number of languages is not limited.<\/p>\n\n<h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cinecita.org\/en\/index\/diary\/\">Blog<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>The site has a totally integrated blog with built in ATOM and RSS newsfeed. Some parts of the website are altered by the staff of CineCita while they are on tour. They can use a WYSIWYG-editor and don\u2019t have to mess around with HTML so much.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"gridWidth5 gridPos5\">\n<h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cinecita.org\/en\/index\/static\/static\/tour\">An Interactive Map<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>is providing a quick overview on the CineCita tour plan and lets the user navigate through the tourstops. The results of the workshops held by CineCita will be availabe there.<\/p>\n<h3>Animations<\/h3>\n<p>are transporting Emotions. You have to see this on the life site. The header is animated everywhere and when a submenu is loaded the little girl in the upper right corner is opening the curtain. No Flash was used at all, we tested how far we could go without it. Frontend tools where <a href=\"http:\/\/jquery.com\/\">jQuery<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/flowplayer.org\/tools\/index.html\">jQuery Tools<\/a> and of course <a href=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/xhtml1\/\">XHTML 1.0 Strict<\/a><\/p>\n\n<h3>Ajax<\/h3>\n<p>Progressive enhancement ensures that the page works good without Javascript. However \u2014 when Javascript is running \u2014 the contents are cached and the page-frame must not be requested every time. This keeps the feeling of the page intact and improves the control over the animated curtain.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n<\/div><div class=\"gridRow\">\n\n<div class=\"gridWidth10 gridPos0\">\n<p><img src=\"\/images\/diary\/cinecita_interactive-map.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the CineCita website in spanish, showing a map with some dots that stand for tourstops.

At <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cinecita.org\/en\/index\/static\/static\/workshops\">workshops<\/a> videos are produced by local girls and women. The videos are delivered by the good and scaleable services of <a href=\"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/\">Vimeo<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\">YouTube<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>The Embedded Slideshows<\/h3>\n<p>are loading image albums from <a href=\"http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\">Googles Picasa<\/a> and displaying them in the article. The CineCita people are using this feature <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cinecita.org\/en\/index\/diary\/filter\/photo\">a lot in their blog articles<\/a> to show the wonderful places they visit on their journey. <\/p><p>The code  It is a very modified version of <a href=\"http:\/\/pwi.googlecode.com\/\">pwi - Picasa Webalbum Integrator<\/a>. Best Thing: the heavy lifting of massive image delivery is done by Google.<\/p>\n<h2>The Graphic Design<\/h2>\n<p>is by <a href=\"http:\/\/10hoch16.de\">10hoch16.de.<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gridWidth6 gridPos4\">\n<p><img src=\"\/images\/diary\/cinecita_embedded-slideshow.png\" alt=\"Part of a Screenshot of the CineCita website showing an embedded slideshow.
